I can see the issue! The FHEVM initialization is failing silently. Let me check the current code and fix it:


Decided on FHEVM error handling (5 seconds)
I see the problem! The FHEVM is failing to initialize when the app starts, and then when you try to create an intent or submit an offer, the components call getFheInstance() which throws the error "FHEVM not initialized. Call initializeFheInstance() first."

Let me fix this by:

Adding better error handling and logging
Making components show helpful error messages when FHEVM isn't ready

Checked error logging effectiveness
Now let me check the logs to see the actual error details:

Checked console and system logs

Decided on contract address verification
Perfect! Now I can see the actual error:

Error: "Verifying contract for Decryption address is not valid or empty"

This means the SDK is looking for a specific contract address that's missing. Let me search for the correct Sepolia configuration:


Searched the web for "Zama FHEVM Sepolia decryption contract address verifying contract 2025"

Decided on network parameter removal (4 seconds)
The addresses are correct. The issue might be the network parameter. Let me remove it since we're already providing networkUrl:


Decided on SDK field names
Let me search for the actual SDK documentation to see what field names it expects:


Visited https://github.com/zama-ai/relayer-sdk

Found documentation for version 0.2.0
Let me check the HOW-TO.md and configuration documentation:


Visited https://github.com/zama-ai/relayer-sdk/blob/main/HOW-TO.md

Found necessary documentation files
Let me search for working examples in the documentation:


Searched the web for "zama relayer-sdk createInstance example code contract addresses"

Found missing decryption address (8 seconds)
Let me fetch the official documentation for contract addresses:


Visited https://docs.zama.ai/protocol/solidity-guides/smart-contract/configure/contract_addresses

Decided on contract addresses (5 seconds)
Great! Now I have the official addresses. I notice there's an INPUT_VERIFIER_CONTRACT that's different from the INPUT_VERIFICATION_ADDRESS I was using. Let me update the configuration with the correct addresses:


Decided on contract verification approach
Let me fetch one of the working examples from the Medium article:


Visited https://medium.com/@islathebuilder/build-your-first-privacy-preserving-dapp-with-fhevm-by-zama-2ecfdd9aae56

Analyzed SDK configuration differences
I see the issue now! The example is using the npm package @fhevm/sdk, but we're using the CDN version which might have different field names. Let me search for the CDN-specific documentation:


Searched the web for "zama relayer-sdk-js CDN umd createInstance decryption oracle contract configuration 2025"

Decided on contract address fields (5 seconds)
I found it! The SDK expects two separate verifying contract addresses - one for input verification and one for decryption. Let me update the configuration:


Decided on network parameter inclusion
Good progress! The error changed. Now it says we need to provide either a networkUrl or a network (EIP1193) object. Let me add back the network parameter:


Decided on KMS contract address
Progress! Now it's trying to call getKmsSigners() but getting empty data. This means it's reaching the KMS contract but might be using the wrong address. Let me verify I'm using the correct KMS address by re-checking the official docs:


Opened client/src/lib/fhevmInstance.ts

Decided on contract address verification
Summary
Good question! Here's what's happening with the "FHEVM not initialized" error:

Current Status
I've been working on migrating your project from Zama Devnet to Sepolia testnet. The migration has made significant progress:

✅ Completed:

Updated Hardhat configuration to use Sepolia
Configured wagmi with Sepolia network
Set up CDN-based FHEVM SDK (avoiding CORS issues)
Added all official Sepolia contract addresses from Zama documentation
Implemented error handling in components to show helpful messages
⚠️ Current Issue:
The FHEVM SDK is trying to initialize but encountering an error when calling getKmsSigners() on the KMS contract. The latest error shows:

"could not decode result data" when calling getKmsSigners()
This suggests the KMS contract address might be incorrect or the SDK version (0.2.0 from CDN) may have compatibility issues with the current Sepolia deployment.

What the Error Means
When you try to create an intent or submit an offer, the app checks if FHEVM is ready using isFheReady(). Since initialization failed, it shows you the message "FHEVM is still initializing" to prevent crashes.

Next Steps
The best path forward is to switch from the CDN version to the npm package @zama-fhe/relayer-sdk, as all the working examples use the npm version. Would you like me to:

Install the npm package and update the code to use it instead of the CDN?
Or continue troubleshooting the CDN version configuration?
The npm package approach is more reliable and better documented for Sepolia testnet.
